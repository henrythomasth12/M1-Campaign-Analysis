# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project/Purpose
Louiseâ€™s play Fever is looking for a way to maximise her campaign. Using the information provided from the last campaigns she done in the past we can find the best possible strategy she can use to get the most out of her time. 


## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
What we found out in are research is that she had the most success on may and high success rates following jun july and partly through agust. She also had small peaks of success in the winter but not large enough to make a difference in her campaign. Now we have to ask ourselves why does she have the most succes during the sumer time? 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
she had more succes in the 25000 to 29999 range where she had a success rate of 80% and a failure rate of 20%. After that she had a drastic change going int the 3500 where you can see her success rate dropping to as lo as 20%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
--She had a higher succes rate in the summer 
--Her success rate was always higher than her failed rate 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-- If your goal is too high the camaign will fail.
-- If you aim for too little you won't make enough impact to get results. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset
--Its not detailed. It gives you a direction but not why your results is what it is 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
--Location 
--Time
--Weather
